**The bioinformatics project**: *Inferring the infection pathway of influenza*

2018 SFU Invent the Future

In this project, students will learn how computational biology can allow us to predict future strains of viruses, in order to preventatively make vaccines before outbreaks occur. 

Phylogenetic trees are widely used in biology to represent evolutionary relationships between species, such as how wolves are related to domesticated dogs. In these trees, leaves represent currently living species, and the internal branches indicate speciation events, where new species were thought to be created. The overall structure and shape of a phylogenetic tree reveals useful information such as the rate of new species formation and extinction. Tree balance usually refers to the structure of the tree, and branch lengths show the time or genetic distance between branching or speciation events.

Phylogenetic trees can also be used to extract information from viral/bacterial/vector speciation events generated by disease outbreaks. This information can be used to analyze the rate and patterns of how new species of virus/bacteria/vectors evolve, providing valuable information towards the development of vaccinations and preventative measures.
